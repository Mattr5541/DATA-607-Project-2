# Diabetes Dataset Analysis

by Team Android (Jean Jimenez, Matthew Roland, Kelly Eng)

This repository contains a simple analysis for the Diabetes dataset, which contains a list of individuals with and without diabetes, as well as different risk factors for developing diabetes (i.e., age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, the diabetes pedigree function, etc.). 
This dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aemyjutt/diabetesdataanslysis), and was suggested by Folorunsho Atanda on Blackboard
