## Introduction

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a Diabetes dataset. The dataset includes information on individuals both with and without diabetes. Various risk factors for developing diabetes, such as age, BMI, glucose and insulin levels, and the diabetes pedigree function, are also part of this dataset. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was recommended for study by Folorunsho Atanda on Blackboard.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of multiple predictors related to diabetes, including but not limited to:
- Age
- BMI
- Glucose Levels
- Insulin Levels
- Blood Pressure
- Diabetes Pedigree Function

## Analysis Summary

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was initially cleaned to group all predictors of diabetes under a single column.
  
2. **Descriptive Analysis**: Various statistical measures, such as mean and median, were calculated to understand the risk factors associated with diabetes. 

3. **Pedigree Function Analysis**: The diabetes pedigree function was analyzed to determine its effectiveness as a predictive marker for diabetes. Our analysis suggests that while it is a useful marker, it may not be the most reliable indicator by itself.

4. **Predictor Averages**: Mean values for each predictor were calculated and compared between the diabetes-positive and diabetes-negative groups. Elevated levels of insulin and glucose appeared to be strong predictors for diabetes.

5. **Blood Pressure Distribution**: A focused analysis was conducted on the distribution of blood pressure in both diabetes-positive and diabetes-negative groups. The distributions were found to be similar, although the mean blood pressure was slightly higher in the diabetes-positive group.

## Conclusions

- Insulin and glucose levels appear to be the most impactful predictors for having diabetes.
- The diabetes pedigree function can serve as a risk marker but may not be sufficient as a standalone predictive tool.
- Blood pressure, although slightly higher in diabetes-positive individuals, does not show a significant difference between the two groups. Therefore, it may not serve as a reliable standalone predictor for diabetes.
